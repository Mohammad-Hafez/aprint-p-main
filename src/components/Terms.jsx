    <h2>Returns Policy</h2>
    <p>All APrint products are manufactured to the highest standards, checked by our strict quality-control procedures, and shipped via a signed-for-on-collection courier service.</p>
    <p>You will have approved and signed off the artwork online before production when printing is involved.</p>
    <p>You must check your delivery from us on arrival before signing for it.</p>
    <p>If your goods arrive faulty or damaged due to delivery, we will resupply the required items. We ask that you email us with photographs of the fault or damage.</p>
    <p>If bespoke printed or manufactured items have been signed for as received in good condition, we cannot offer replacements, reprints, or refunds.</p>

    <h3>Your Right to Cancel and The Distance Selling Regulations</h3>
    <p>All customers have the right to cancel their orders under the Distance Selling Regulations, which gives consumers extra protection when buying online. The specific legislation that applies here is Regulation 8 of The Distance Selling Regulations.</p>
    <p>You have the right to cancel the purchase of goods without having to give a reason at any time within the “cooling off period” of seven working days, beginning on the day after you receive the goods. However, this does not apply to bespoke printed or manufactured items.</p>
    <p>If you have the goods, you must retain them and take reasonable care of them. You must send the goods back to us to our contact address at your own cost (unless we delivered the item to you in error or the item is damaged or defective) as soon as possible once you have cancelled the contract.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to make a charge not exceeding our direct costs of recovering the goods if you do not return them or return them at our expense.</p>
    <p>Once you have notified us that you wish to cancel the contract, any sum debited to us will be refunded to you as soon as possible and, in any event, within 30 days of your cancellation.</p>
    <p>You will not have any right to cancel a purchase for the supply of any of the following goods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The supply of goods made to your specifications or personalised or which, because of their nature, cannot be returned or are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly.</li>
    </ul>
